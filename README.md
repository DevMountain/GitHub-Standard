# Project Summary

This is where the summary of the project will go. Explain what the student will be doing in order to complete the project. Also explain what the project is.

Include a screenshot of the finished project's landing page here.

( Optional: If the project can run on GH-Pages, include that link here )

## Step 1

### Summary

This is where the summary of the step will go. Explain what the student will be doing and how it modifies the project. Try to make steps that only edit one file, even if the step is super small. 

### Instructions

This is where the basic instructions will go. Use a bullet list format. If multiple objectives are need to complete a task in the step, use a nested bullet format. Try to start a bullet item with an action/verb. If the bullet is a sentence, end it with a period. If you are building an afternoon section, include a `Detailed Instructions` section for every step. If you are building a mini project, you do not have to include a `Detailed Instructions` section because an instructor will be able to explain on a more detailed level. Always start your bullet list by explaining what file the student should open.

* Open `path/to/file`.
* Do X.
* Do Y:
  * Do this to accomplish Y.
  * Do this to accomplish Y.
  * Use this code to accomplish Y:
    * <details>

      <summary> <code> Code Snippet Title </code> </summary>

      ```js
      /*
        You can put code snippets in bullet lists as well. However make sure the code snippet is on it's own indentation level. Otherwise your bullet list will become double spaced.
      */
      ```
      </details>
* Do Z.

<details>

<summary> Detailed Instructions </summary>

<br />

This is where the detailed instructions will go. Break down the bullet list one by one and go into detail on how to complete the item. Use a combination of code snippets/pictures if you feel it will help explain the item. Also include why the student is doing the item or how it modifies the project. The more detail the better. Since the Detailed Instructions is hidden by default don't worry about how long this section is.

</details>

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> path/to/file </code> </summary>

```js
/*

Always include a hidden code solution for each step. This can either be the entire file or just the things that changed in the file. If you end up doing a solution that is not the entire file, be sure to specify that to the student to avoid confusion.

*/
```

</details>

<br />

Include a screenshot or giphy of the completed step in action.

## Step 2

Repeat the format of step 1.

## Step 3

Repeat the format of step 1.

## Black Diamond

Include a couple challenges to push the project farther. This can just be a bulleted list of objectives to hit. You do not have to supply a solution or any instructions for this area.

* Modify the project to do Y.
* Add local storage to the project.
* Build a back end for the front end.
